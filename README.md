The Music Ontology
==================

About
-----

The [Music Ontology](http://purl.org/ontology/mo/) provides main concepts and properties fo describing music (i.e. artists, albums, tracks, but also performances, arrangements, etc.) on the Semantic Web.

All pushes to master are now automatically deployed using a [post-receive hook](https://github.com/motools/musicontology-postreceive).

PS
--

The [old project repository location at SourceForge](http://motools.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/motools/mo/) is now deprecated. All new developments will be pushed to this repository location here at GitHub.
